# Apex Legends Composition Generator (ALCG)

This web app is used to generate a random composition legend from Apex Legends based on user-specified parameters for the classes of the legends.

When you enter the app, you can immediately press the "Generate Composition" button or Spacebar(press or hold) to generate a new composition. Above each legend image, you can choose what class of legend from which you want to generate. Ex: Choosing Assault, Defense, and Recon may generate Horizon, Wattson, and Bloodhound.

I made this app because I wanted a way for myself and others to have random fun in pubs whilst also having a team that is catered to our needs and preferences. Also, it was a good way to learn Javascript and HTML as it tought me a lot about css formatting and and the basics of front-end web development. I have been working on this project on and off for many months but have finally decided to finish it and share it with the world to enjoy!

This project is open-source so feel free help improve on it and let me know what you think! I had a lot of fun with this project and I hope you do, too. I will be releasing a video about how I made it soon.
